### Book tickets, pack your spacesuit and get ready to see the Moon in all its glory!
You can purchase a ticket of dream [here] (https://sob96.github.io/spaceApp/).

Log in (`Login`),
Look for information about interesting planets (`Search` and `SearchPage`)
or just spin a slider with prepared info (`Slider` and `SliderContent`).
And finally book your ticket! (`Order` and `User`)

In this project I mastered:
- ReactJS
- react-create-app
- react-router-dom
- localStorage
- ant design and bootstrap
- simple authorization
- search component
- slider component
- work with a cart

All components are in the src folder. All another files was generated by react-create-app.

You can run this project locally just do:

- clone a branch with git clone [https://github.com/Sob96/spaceApp.git] (https://github.com/Sob96/spaceApp.git) or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
- cd spaceApp
- npm install
- npm start
